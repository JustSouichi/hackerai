# HackerAI - Link Confirmation

HackerAI is an open-source Chrome extension designed to improve online security for beginners and small businesses. It provides a lightweight solution to mitigate phishing attacks and suspicious links by prompting the user for confirmation before opening any link.

## Key Features
- **Link Confirmation Dialog**: Displays a confirmation dialog before opening any link, ensuring users are aware of their actions.
- **Support for Custom Links**: Handles both standard HTML links (`<a>` tags) and custom attributes like `data-link`.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Designed for non-technical users to add an extra layer of security.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Minimal performance impact while providing essential protection.
- **Open-Source**: Fully transparent codebase, open to contributions and community collaboration.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JustSouichi/hackerai.git
   ```
2. Go to the Chrome Extensions page by typing `chrome://extensions/` in your browser.
3. Enable **Developer mode** in the top-right corner.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder containing the project files.
5. The extension is now active and ready to use!

## How It Works
HackerAI injects a content script (`content.js`) into all web pages. This script intercepts clicks on links and displays a confirmation dialog, allowing the user to decide whether to proceed or cancel.

### Example Workflow:
1. A user clicks on a link.
2. A dialog appears:
   ```
   Do you really want to open this link?
   https://example.com
   ```
3. The user can choose to proceed or cancel.

This simple yet effective mechanism helps prevent accidental clicks on malicious or phishing links.

## Code Overview

### `manifest.json`
Defines the extensionâ€™s metadata and permissions:
```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "HackerAI - Link Confirmation",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Prompts confirmation before opening a link.",
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### `content.js`
Handles link interception and confirmation prompts:
```javascript
document.body.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
    let target = event.target;

    while (target && target !== document.body) {
      if (target.tagName === 'A' && target.href) {
        event.preventDefault();
        const confirmed = confirm(`Do you really want to open this link?
${target.href}`);
        if (confirmed) {
          window.location.href = target.href;
        }
        return;
      } else if (target.getAttribute && target.getAttribute('data-link')) {
        event.preventDefault();
        const link = target.getAttribute('data-link');
        const confirmed = confirm(`Do you really want to open this link?
${link}`);
        if (confirmed) {
          window.location.href = link;
        }
        return;
      }
      target = target.parentElement;
    }
});
```

1. **AI-Powered Link Analysis**:
   - Use machine learning to analyze links in real-time for potential phishing or malicious activity.
   - Highlight risky links with visual cues.

2. **Phishing Database Integration**:
   - Compare URLs against known phishing databases for additional security.
   - Provide detailed warnings about flagged links.

3. **Email Security Features**:
   - Scan email links and attachments for potential threats.
   - Detect and flag suspicious patterns in email content.

4. **Customizable Confirmation Prompts**:
   - Allow users to customize the confirmation message.
   - Include additional context, such as website reputation scores.

5. **Integration with Antivirus Tools**:
   - Collaborate with existing antivirus solutions for enhanced threat detection.
   - Provide seamless interoperability between HackerAI and third-party security tools.

6. **User-Friendly Dashboard**:
   - Add a simple interface to view blocked links and security reports.
   - Enable users to adjust security settings and monitor flagged URLs.
